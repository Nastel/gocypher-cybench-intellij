# CyBench-IntelliJ

CyBench is an integrated code benchmark platform for running, storing, analyzing & comparing performance benchmarks with
one mission: help you build fast code.

Benchmark your code, algorithms, platforms, modules, libraries, API calls, JVMs, Java garbage collection (GC) settings.
Test with varying runtime configurations, versions and more. Avoid making costly mistakes, which can wreck your
reputation and user experience.

Create & share performance scorecards with your team & community. Compare and choose best performing runtime
configurations, libraries, code dependencies for your project.

Leverage Java Microbenchmark Harness -JMH benchmarks and integrate into your development, build and CI/CD workflow.

IntelliJ CyBench plugin simplifies your work creating and running benchmarks. The plugin creates two tool windows to
work with the reports:

* explorer view - shows you your reports already generated in project and enables you to open the selected plugin
* reports view - show the opened reports by explorer view

  to open `generate` menu, and select `CyBenchBenchmark`
* Step 3:    If it's needed plugin asks you to add the libraries to classpath and/or dependencies
* Step 4:    Run generated benchmark
* Step 5:    Open the CyBench explorer window (hit refresh if you don't see the report generated)
* Step 6:    Select the report to open it.

## Detailed instructions

### Generate benchmark stubs

Feature generates benchmark class stubs, adds necessary annotations and methods for a selected JAVA file. Benchmark
method is generated for each public method found in the class.

Pre-conditions:

* Selected file is Java file
* Index for IntelliJ files is already built

Steps:

* Select any JAVA class file in the project explorer which meets pre-conditions.
* Select menu Code->Generate (alt+ins)
* Select CyBench Generate.

### Run

If it's benchmark classes, gutter button for running benchmark on benchmark classes will appear.

For a quick run, with default configuration press `Run 'run config name' ctrl+shift+f10`.

Once the benchmarking is finished, the report will be created in project directory under `reports` child. You can view
all reports in Explorer window.
